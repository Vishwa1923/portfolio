      <h2>Vishwajeet Kulkarni</h2>
      <p>I am a data-oriented professional with a solid computer science background and a Master’s in Cybersecurity and Privacy. I specialize in solving complex problems using artificial intelligence, cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, and secure computing principles. With hands-on experience in the healthcare, automotive, and finance sectors, I’ve translated theoretical knowledge into actionable insights through projects such as car price prediction, COVID-19 fatality forecasting, and intelligent transportation systems. My work emphasizes both scalability and compliance, integrating data ingestion, processing, and visualization with robust IAM and security practices.</p>
    
      <p>My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Flask, Tableau, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, and cybersecurity tools like ProDiscover. I’m a fast learner who collaborates well across disciplines and communicates findings through dashboards, documentation, and storytelling. I believe that true data science lies not just in modeling but in making data meaningful, secure, and usable. Explore my portfolio to see how I create ethical, scalable, and data-driven solutions.</p>
